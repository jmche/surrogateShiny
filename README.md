Surrogate Mutation Explorer Code
This code is for the webapp available at https://tladeras.shinyapps.io/surrogateShiny/

surrogate-table.txt is the main data file which is separated by Breast cancer cell line (Sample) and Gene (rows). A Sample-Gene pair makes a unique id for each row in the surrogate table, which allows the webapp to pull up network graphs based on the id of the row.
